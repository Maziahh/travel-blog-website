              During my trip, I learnt more on China's culture and lifestyle. The experience was eye opening and a worthwhile one, where I also gain connections with the China students and students who were in the same trip as me. One of China's culture which I learn is they drink tea and family is one of their top priorities. The economy of the technology sector has also been growing at a rising rate, hence, Ngee Ann Polytechnic gave ICT students like me to go to Shenzhen to learn more on the trends and update of technology. For example, articficial intelligence is constantly developing in companies such as the one we visited, Tencent. Additionally, China has started using 5G network, enabling quick transfer. ü§Ø

             As mentioned above, I met and gained lifelong friendships with the China students and the students who were in the same trip as me. At the start of the trip, I only had a few acquaintances who I knew in the trip, however, the trip allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and strengthen our bonds with one another. We created great and memorable friendships, experiencing and learning new things.

              Through our exploration in Shenzhen, China, we went to multiple cultural visits such like "Splendid China", where one of the entertainments had different dynasties displayed in one of the performances. At the same area, me and my group mates went to a place that looked like a "Snow City" lookalike in Singapore. We had an extremely great time playing with the slides and snow inside. ‚ùÑÔ∏è

            In addition, we tried the food there and it was a life changing moment as the food served was not only cheap, but a big portion.
