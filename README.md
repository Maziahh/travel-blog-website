# travel-bog-website
in this github our team has put together a multi-page website that is a travel blog utilising different libraries to create interactive pages for users that are interested in travelling.

instructions for teammates:
- i have created different files that contains code for each section so you guys can just copy pasted it into your vscode
- When you make changes pls dont immediately add to main. Instead, create a branch and make a pull request so that we can all agree on it.
